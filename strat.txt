Strategy

If your assignment is to design and implement a "strategy", the program will call your new function and you must return a card number.

    int Strategy(int player)
    {
        return(card)
    }

The input to your function is:   int player   which can have the value of 0 or 1

And you must return a number (cards are numbered 1-13 for A,2,...,10,J,Q,K) that follows the Go-Fish rules.

Your strategy will need to get integrated in with strategies from other students, so you must follow a series of coding "standards".

First, please include the following header files:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <string.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <conio.h>

    #include "gofish.h"
    #include "extern.h"


Inside the file: gofish.h, you will see the data structures and a #define that identifies the range of card numbers:

    #define MINNUMB   1 
    #define MAXNUMB  13

 

Inside the file: extern.h, you will see the global variables.
There are three that might be of value to your strategy:

    info[player].lastcard	// the number of the last card you requested

    info[player].lastpick       // the number of the card you picked up from the deck

    info[1-player].lastcard     // the number of the last card your opponent asked for


And you might also need to one function call in your strategy function:

    TotalNumberOfCards(player,card)
 // returns 0-3 as per the number of cards you have in your hand

(And no peaking at the other players hand)

If you need a static variable, you must remember that your function can be entered with player=0 or player=1
and you must separate information from between the two players.
